# ! DISCLAIMER

Despite the most of the labs in this course can be done using the AWS free tier, i.e. without any charging, there a couple of tasks that require creation of paid resources.
Resources like NAT Gateway, Route53 zone etc., will cost you some money (but not that much, fortunately). Anyway, before creating any type of resources, please be sure you carefully read and understood the appropriate pricing policy. Every type of resource is AWS has its own pricing page, for example [Route53 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/). If you cannot find the pricing policy in official AWS documentation, just google it, for example "NAT gateway pricing".
To avoid extra money expenditures, you can [set up a billing alert](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/monitor_estimated_charges_with_cloudwatch.html) that will notify you immediately after you have reached some threshold in your billing.
And of course, do not forget cleaning up all the unnecessary resources after completing the lab.

# Amazon Web Services
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the worldâ€™s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally.
AWS has the most extensive global cloud infrastructure. No other cloud provider offers as many Regions with multiple Availability Zones connected by low latency, high throughput, and highly redundant networking. AWS has 80 Availability Zones within 25 geographic regions around the world, and has announced plans for 15 more Availability Zones and 5 more AWS Regions.
