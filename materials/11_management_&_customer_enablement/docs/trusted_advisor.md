### Service Overview

AWS Trusted Advisor is an online tool that provides a real time guidance to help provision resources following AWS best practices. Trusted Advisor inspects resources across all AWS Regions and presents a summary of check results. Trusted Advisor checks help optimize AWS infrastructure, improve security and performance, reduce overall costs, and monitor service limits.

### Use cases / Considerations

Trusted Advisor includes an ever-expanding list of checks in the following five categories:

- Cost optimization – recommendations that can potentially save money by highlighting unused resources and opportunities to reduce the bill.
- Security - Trusted Advisor can improve the security of application by closing gaps, enabling various AWS security features, and examining permissions.
- Fault Tolerance - recommendations that help increase the resiliency of Amazon Web Services solution by highlighting redundancy shortfalls, current service limits, and overutilized resources.
- Performance - recommendations that can help to improve the speed and responsiveness of applications.
- Service Limits – Trusted Advisor checks for service usage that is more than 80% of the service limit.

The status of checks are:

- Red: action recommended
- Yellow: investigation recommended
- Green: no problem detected

### Cautions

Trusted Advisor Service Limits values are based on a snapshot, so current usage might differ. Limit and usage data can take up to 24 hours to reflect any changes.

### Pricing considerations

Available categories and number of checks depends on AWS support plan (Basic, Developer, Business, Enterprise).
