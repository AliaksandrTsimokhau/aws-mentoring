### General description:

AWS Support offers a range of plans that provide access to tools and expertise that support your AWS solutions&#39; success and operational health. All support plans provide 24/7 access to customer service, AWS documentation, technical papers, and support forums. For technical support and more resources to plan, deploy, and improve your AWS environment, you can choose a support plan that best aligns with your AWS use case.

##### _Note_:

_Good idea moving from basic to more high plan just when it needs only. For instance, if you need additional support from AWS or_ _temporarily_ _need to have some features which available only in more high plans, you can get it in the next 30 days. And after, to move back to the basic (develop) plan._

##### _Keep in mind_:

_For urgently contact with AWS support, use a chat or phone call as an answer method._

### Monitoring status

You can easy to monitor all statuses of your case in the Support Center. A flow looks like this:

1. Unassigned
2. Work in Progress (WIP)
3. Pending Customer Action (ask for more information) or Pending Amazon Action (let you know that the case is being investigated)
4. The last status is close Case. It means your problem is solved.  If you don&#39;t respond within ten days, the case is closed automatically. Nevertheless, you can always reopen a resolved or closed case.

For each update, you receive email with the correspondence and a link to the case in Support Center.

##### _Important note_:

- _You can&#39;t respond to case correspondence by email. Use the link in the email to navigate to the support case._
- _You must sign in to the AWS account that submitted the support case. If you sign in as an IAM user, you must have the required permissions to view support cases._
