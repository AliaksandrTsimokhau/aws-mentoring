### Task: Create IAM

Pre-requisites:
Already created S3 bucket
Installed jq
Installed AWS cli v1

Create role with AWS managed policy S3 full access
Inline policy ssm:readonly
Customer managed policy kms:Decrypt
with condition for usage for the whole AWS account
Hint: Use policy generator
Assign this policy to new user, add him permission for programmatic api access

Add one more role with ability of assuming by user from previous step
S3 readonly

Verification:
1. credentials retrieval from cli for user
2. write file to existing s3 bucket to test full access
3. perform role assuming using cli
4. make a try to write file from step 2
5. copy file from s3 using cli


Solution levels (could be done in a sequence:
Basic - create IAM roles and user using AWS Console and policy generator, proceed with verification from cli
Medium -  create everything using AWS cli (hint: use policies in json forma from Basic level) and proceed with verification
Pro - create everything using IaC approach with CloudFormation/Terraform, proceed with verification from cli
